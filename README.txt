Assignment 5: Heaps
CSC 300 – Data Structures
Ashish Rai

OVERVIEW
This assignment implements a Max-Heap using an array-based approach. The following heap operations were completed as part of the assignment requirements:

1. **heapifyDown()** – Bubbles down an element to restore the heap after deletion.
2. **buildH()** – Builds a max-heap from an unsorted array.
3. **replace()** – Replaces an existing value in the heap with a new one while maintaining heap structure.
4. **heapSort()** – Sorts an array using heap sort.
5. **switchMinMax()** (Extra Credit) – Converts a Max-Heap to a Min-Heap and vice versa using helper `heapifyDownMin()`.

To compile the program, use the following command:
g++ mainH.cpp heap.cpp -o heap_program
./heap_program inst.txt
